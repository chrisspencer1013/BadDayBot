Hello humans!

My goal with this little python project is to have some run and learn Tweepy/Twitter's API. 

Feel free to make some suggestions if you have any ideas! More animal pics, better logic, more accurate sentiment analysis, whatever you got.

(Please note that I don't want to bombard the world with tweets, so this is an opt-in approach of only retweeting to people that follow the account)
