Hello humans!

My goal with this little python project is to have some fun and learn Tweepy/Twitter's API. 

If anyone ever sees this, feel free to make some suggestions if you have any ideas! More animal pics(currently blatantly stolen from reddit and imgur), better logic, more accurate sentiment analysis, whatever you got. 

(Please note that I don't want to bombard the world with tweets (nor get flagged as a spam account), so this is an opt-in approach of only retweeting to people that follow the account)
